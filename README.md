### This tool violates the PSO2 Terms of Service. While it is currently presumed safe to use and undetectable by GameGuard, [SEGA claims to enforce its use as a bannable offense](http://pso2.jp/players/news/9224/), and action could potentially be taken against your account. Please use caution and discretion.

OverParse is a standalone log reader and overlay for Variant's PSO2DamageDump plugin. It shows damage statistics for you and your MPA in realtime, and provides basic damage breakdowns for later analysis.

You can find downloads on the [Releases](https://github.com/TyroneSama/OverParse/releases) tab. Please read the latest release notes for information on setup.

### Developers

Normally this is the section where I list dependncies and build instructions, but...don't touch this. Seriously. The code is unmaintainable spaghetti, including a massive and crippling hack to partially implement AIS separation, and anyone who can make sense of it is better off writing their own tool. I AM NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTER
