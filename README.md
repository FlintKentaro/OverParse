# OverParse

#### Setup

Enable the Damage Parser plugin in PSO2 Tweaker. Run the game. Run OverParse. If it complains about a folder path, go to System > Locate Install Folder and find your pso2_bin folder (you will only need to do this once).

Anything and everything may be broken.

#### Developers
It's a mess. Thankfully, it's small enough in scope that it can be followed despite the mess, but you'd probably be better off spending your time doing literally anything else.
