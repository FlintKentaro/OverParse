SETUP:
Open the program and follow the prompts. Don't worry, it's not complicated.

-----

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Program doesn't launch at all
Disable your antivirus before launching, or add OverParse.exe to your AV's whitelist.
- PSO2 drops frames / runs slower with OverParse active
This is a Windows problem with layered windows: move OverParse off your game, or disable the Always On Top option in the Window menu.
